# azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool_address

Manages a Backend Address within a Backend Address Pool.

-> **Note:** Backend Addresses can only be added to a `Standard` SKU Load Balancer.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-network"
  resource_group_name = "example-resources"
}

data "azurerm_lb" "example" {
  name                = "example-lb"
  resource_group_name = "example-resources"
}

data "azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool" "example" {
  name            = "first"
  loadbalancer_id = data.azurerm_lb.example.id
}

resource "azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool_address" "example" {
  name                    = "example"
  backend_address_pool_id = data.azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool.example.id
  virtual_network_id      = data.azurerm_virtual_network.example.id
  ip_address              = "10.0.0.1"
}
```

## Arguments Reference

-> **Note:** Backend Addresses can only be added to a `Standard` SKU Load Balancer.

The following arguments are supported:

* `backend_address_pool_id` - (Required) The ID of the Backend Address Pool. Changing this forces a new Backend Address Pool Address to be created.

* `ip_address` - (Required) The Static IP Address which should be allocated to this Backend Address Pool.

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Backend Address Pool Address. Changing this forces a new Backend Address Pool Address to be created.

* `virtual_network_id` - (Required) The ID of the Virtual Network within which the Backend Address Pool should exist.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported: 

* `id` - The ID of the Backend Address Pool Address.

* `inbound_nat_rule_port_mapping` - A list of `inbound_nat_rule_port_mapping` block as defined below.

A `inbound_nat_rule_port_mapping` block exports the following:

* `inbound_nat_rule_name` - The name of the Load Balancing Inbound NAT Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool Address.

* `frontend_port` - The Frontend Port of the Load Balancing Inbound NAT Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool Address.

* `backend_port` - The Backend Port of the Load Balancing Inbound NAT Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool Address.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Backend Address Pool Address.
