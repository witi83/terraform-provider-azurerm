* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Azure IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Must be globally unique.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the Azure IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `sku_name` - (Required) Specifies the SKU Name for this IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment. Currently it supports only `L1`. For gen2, capacity cannot be specified.

* `warm_store_data_retention_time` - (Required) Specifies the ISO8601 timespan specifying the minimum number of days the environment's events will be available for query. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `storage` - (Required) A `storage` block as defined below.

* `id_properties` - (Required) A list of property ids for the Azure IoT Time Series Insights Gen2 Environment. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. 

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.
